Sc # 1 Day, Interiors
Corporate Office – Conference Hall
Black screen. 
In the background, a bass note is heard. It is gaining volume, causing unrest. 
Fade-in. Aditya's face in close. He is staring into the blank. Cut to mid shot. Some movements  
are seen behind him and in front. Cut to mid-long shot. We see a lawyer standing behind Aditya, speaking  
vehemently. Cut to long shot. More movement comes into view. We still hear no sound. Some other men  
in suits are seen, contributing to the tense conversation. Lots of people talking together. Aditya is sitting  
at the head of the table. There is a middle aged woman sitting across the table to him. Raghav, Aditya's  
colleague, touches his shoulder. Aditya looks at Raghav. Raghav looks cross. Sound fades in – loud,  
incomprehensible din. Chief in that is the woman's lawyer reading out certain demands from the  
company. 
Lawyer 1(continuing) …on the other hand you should be happy that my client is not insisting on  
going to court. Although court jaane mein inka fayda hai. Chaar hearings mein baat saaf ho jayegi ki ye  
kya deserve karti hain aur inko is company se kya milna chahiye.
The noise attacks the senses. Aditya sits amidst the madness for a while, then slowly gets up.  
Meanwhile, the noise continues off-camera –
RaghavI don't think we should jump to conclusions. 
Lawyer 2Yahan milne ka matlab yehi hai ki hum Mrs Khanna ki demands ko consider kar rahe  
hain. 
Lawyer 1Humne aapko consider karne ko nahin kaha hai. Aapki authourity nahin hai consider  
karne ki.
RaghavExcuse me… hum jhagda karne ke liye nahin mil rahe hain… 
LawyerLet me tell you that there can be no compromise on the list of demands made by Mrs Khanna.

Corporate Office – Washroom, Corridor
Aditya stands facing the mirror in the wash room. He is looking down. After a moment, he looks  
up towards his eyes. He lacks the courage to look at himself. He looks down. 
He comes out of the washroom, looks at the conference hall. Raghav is standing at the door of the  
conference hall, waiting for him. He indicates to him to hurry back, the others are waiting. Raghav goes  
inside. Aditya looks at the conference hall. Through the glass, he sees Raghav telling the others that  
Aditya is coming back now. Aditya can see that the situation is waiting to explode on him. He stands there  
for a moment. Then instead of going towards the conference hall, Aditya turns right into the staircase.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Corporate Office – Foyer, Porch
Aditya walks into the foyer. The staff and visitors jerk into attention. Some salute, some wish,  
somebody runs towards the porch. 
Aditya's black BMW drives into the porch. 
Someone opens the car door for Aditya. Aditya walks down the steps, does not go to the open  
door. He walks around and takes the key from the driver and sits in the car.

Sc # 4 Evening, Int / Exteriors
Club House Reception Ceremony
The car drives into a club house and parks. Aditya gets off. 
 page : 4 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Many men and women – all decked up in fineries – notice Aditya as he walks in. There is a  
reaction of surprise. Aditya comes to the lawn and looks straight. A wedding reception platform, bride and  
groom and guests and photographers. The bride sees him. He is walking towards her. She gets tense. He  
gets into the line of people waiting to meet the couple. 
Aditya gets up on the platform, walks towards the girl, stands in front of her. She looks at the  
groom. The groom extends his hand to Aditya. They shake hands. 
The photographers ask them to pose. Aditya poses. Snap, snap, snap. 
He looks at the bride one more time, then turns and walks away.  
He walks through the corridor, walks into the parking lot and comes to his car. He unlocks the  
car, opens the door. He stands in that position, looking at the keys. Music of receding begins. Aditya  
places the key on top of the car. 
[As he turns away from the bride and walks, ambient sound begins to fade out. By the time he places the  
key on top of the car, the soundtrack is completely silent.]
{1/2 min}
Title Sequence
The music of receding plays. Aditya turns. Titles begin. His mind is a blank, his senses diffused.  
He walks out. 
Outside the club, Aditya walks the lane – as though some force is taking him away. He opens his  
coat buttons and removes the tie. 
Return office traffic has begun. He puts his tie on the pavement, crosses the street.
 page : 5 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Aditya walks across a market place.  
He walks on another street. He removes his coat, places it on a railing. A beggar is looking at  
him. He removes his gold cuff-links. Cuff-links fall on the pavement. 
He walks across a bus-stop, pulling his sleeves. A bus stops. People file in from around him. He  
turns and looks at the bus. 
 
He is sitting in the bus. His co-passengers keep changing. 
Evening. The bus comes to a final halt outside VT station. Everyone gets off. Aditya gets out. 
VT railway station. Aditya walks in. 
He walks through the crowd in the foyer.
He is walking on a platform. Train whistle blows, flurry at the platform. Aditya stops. He looks at  
the train. The train begins to move. Aditya looks at the door coming towards him. It is inviting him. He  
moves up and climbs into the door. The train takes him away.  
The train is leaving the station.
[The ambient sound will be almost inaudible. Only very loud and shrill sounds – like the train whistle –  
will be registered. In the last shot of the train leaving the station, the ambient sound will come back in  
full]

Bombay platform, Train
The platform, seen from the train through a door, is moving faster and faster. There are two men  
standing at the door. One of them – a young man, is hanging out and bringing in pieces of luggage from  
someone still on the platform. Evidently, a girl is trying to catch the speeding train. There is a coolie  
involved, but we can only hear them at this time. 
Geet (OC) Pakdaate jao, pakdaate jao… Bhaisaab ke haat mein do.
One suitcase is already in. It is put on the side by someone. The young man gets off the train and  
takes another suitcase from the coolie and loads it.
 page : 6 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Young Man (to Man 1) Main neeche se pass kar raha hoon. 
Coolie (to Geet) Tum chahadh jaayo pehle…
Geet (OC) Arey tum meri tension mat lo, samaan andar karo jaldi… Ye lo… 
The suitcase is in. Man 1 passes it to the next man who passes it to the next. A bag comes in  
now. Then a plastic shopping bag comes in, stuffed with loose items. Then another plastic bag. Then an  
earthen pot with a flower plant. There are a few others who have collected in the door area in the second  
class sleeper to see the drama. Meanwhile –
Coolie (OC) Hum keh rahe the doo go coolie ka samaan hai…
Geet (OC) Bag dekho bag dekho girega…
Man 1 Abhi aur bhi samaan hai?
Young  Man (OC) Aane do, aane do… 
Geet (OC) Ye lo, ye padko… Haan…
Man 1 Bahut riks hai bahut riks hai… Samne dekhiye…
Geet (OC) Haan dekh rahi hoon, aap jaldi jaldi samaan leejiye… 
Now the young man climbs back in and extends his hand. The girl is pulled up into the running  
train. She clambers in, stands clutching her waist, panting and exhausted. The small gathering is looking  
at her.  
GeetOh… Oh teri… Oh god… Aaj to hadd hi ho gayee, line cross hi ho gayee thi aaj to… (She looks  
at all the people in front. She lets out a laugh.) Pata hai kya, aaj tak life mein  
ek train nahin chhooti meri… Thank you Babaji, mera record tootne se bacha  
liya (to Young Man) Aa gayee hoon main andar. Ab to mera haath chhod do.  
(laughs) Itni bhi sundar nahin hoon main.  
Young Man leaves her hand in a spark and looks embarrassed as Geet points towards him and  
laughs.

Train Passage
Passage in the moving train. The girl is walking up holding a bag and ticket, talking to the three  
people who are following her with her luggage. 
GeetYou know, mujhe Non AC mein chalna better lagta hai. Magar meri family… Kehte hain tum  
ladki ho… jaise mujhe hi nahin pata ki main ladki hoon. (to a passenger) Bhai  
saab A2 hain na?
PassengerHaan…
GeetThank you. (to her helpers) Ab AC se ladki ka kya connection hai, ye mere palle nahin pada.

Train Seats
Aditya is sitting on a seat. From the distance, Geet and the other three walk up. Geet is looking at  
the seat number as she walks. 
GeetI mean koi pehli baari to akele travel kar nahin rahi hoon main… More so is train mein…  Ye to  
samajh lo ki mera second home hai. 
Geet stops, looks at Aditya. She drops her bag, looks at her ticket, looks back at Aditya  
suspiciously. She crosses to face Aditya. 
GeetTicket dikhaana please. 
Aditya is looking down, in a trance. 
GeetHello… Aap se baat kar rahi hoon. Arey? Ye meri seat hai. Twenty four. Kamaal hai? O boss… 
 page : 8 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- She waves her hand in front of his face. He looks up towards her. She thinks he is hearing  
impaired. She mimes, mouthing the words carefully. 
Geet (miming)Ye seat… chaubis…. Meri…
Aditya looks at her, then gets up and sits on twenty three. He looks away. 
(snip)
Geet is opening her jacket and hanging it in between and talking to Aditya. 
GeetYe passage waali seats koi nahin lena chahta, magar main insist karti hoon ki bhaiya passage  
waali seat hi do. Reservation waale uncle bade hairaan pareshaan ho jaate hain magar  
mera funda ye hai ki raaste ke nazdeek rehne… 
(snip)
Geet is adjusting her luggage beneath the lower berth and up on the top berth and talking.
GeetMera safar hai na, is train ke saath khatm nahin hota. No. Aage jaana hai mujhe – Bhatinda…  
Mera ghar hai vahan, family hai… Sab ki hoti hai, meri bhi hai… Hai na?
Bhatinde ki sikhni hoon main… 
(snip)
Geet is getting comfortable in the seat now and talking.
GeetSab kehte hain Mumbai bada crowded hai. Arey? Crowded matlab kya? Crowd hum jaise logon  
se hi to banta hai? Khud bheed ka hissa hain aur takleef bhi khud hi ko hai. So funny… 
Aditya is sitting on his seat, looking the other way. Geet is another posture. 
Geet (OC)Main to ja rahi hoon Mumbai chhod ke – hamesha ke liye. Aayee thi pata hai kab, jab  
Mumbai Bombay tha. Ek naam ke shaher mein aayi, doosre naam ke shaher se ja rahi  
hoon… Achcha batao mujhe ye kya logic hui ki… 
(snip)
Aditya is getting uncomfortable with her talking so much. 
Geet (OC)Hostel, hostel, hostel… St Teresa's boarding school hostel in Shimla, Missionary Hostel  
for College girls in Bombay Central, Government Girls Hostel on Marine Drive…
(snip)
Aditya is restess.
Geet (OC)Mujhe kasam hai aaj ke baad kabhi hostel mein nahin rahoongi. Nafrat ho gayee hai  
mujhe hostels se. I hate hostels. I hate them. 
(snip)
Aditya is more restless. 
Geet (OC)I hope barsaat ke aane se pehle ye roads ki digging band ho jaye varna pata hai kya  
hoga? Anyway mujhe to fark nahin padta kyonki main rahoongi nahin yahan magar jo  
baaki janta hai yahan par…  
Aditya can not take it anymore. He gets up abruptly and walks away. 
Geet (OC)Kya hua? Arey…?

Train Door, Passage
Aditya opens the door of the train and looks out. The rails are clanging along, bushes are  
jumping out from the darkness, poles are whizzing past. He shuts his eyes for a moment. He hears a siren.  
A train is approaching. He looks at the train. The train charges in, crushing the rails, shaking the gravel.  
Aditya clenches his fists on the railing. There is no one near him. His face is getting hard. The train will  
be there in seconds. It's a matter of seconds. It is coming. It is about to reach. 
Geet (OC) Ye kya kar rahe ho?
Aditya gets a start. He turns to look. Geet is standing there, with a towel and soap, come to wash  
her face. He turns to looks at her. 
Geet (OC) Chalti train ka door kabhi nahin kholte. Pata hai kya ho sakta hai? 
He is looking at her. The train tears past behind him. Geet speaks in animation about a young  
boy who was travelling in the same train as her and had fallen off the door once. But nothing she says can  
be heard because of the loud passing of the train. Yet she speaks with all her might. 
(snip)
Aditya turns away to the night. He closes his eyes and relaxes himself. She is washing her face  
behind him. 
Geet (washing face etc) Mook ho, bol nahin sakte? Ya sharmeele type ke ho? Ya sirf budtameez ho?  
Haan? 
Geet shakes her head. Aditya is looking into the night as Geet speaks.
 page : 10 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Geet (OC) Kuch to baat hai. Teen baari main pooch chuki hoon magar koi javaab hi  
nahin. 
TTE (OC) Ticket please. 
The TTE is standing in front of Geet. Geet's face is wet.
Geet Berth pe hai. Aati hoon. 
The TTE walks up to Aditya.
TTE Ticket dekhaiye please. 
No response from Aditya. The TTE taps Aditya. Aditya turns. 
TTE Aur door band kar deejiye. Ticket… 
Geet comes up and begins to mime to Aditya, mouthing what she wants to express. 
Get (miming)Ye tumhaari ticket dekhna chahte hain… Inhien ticket dikhao. Kahan hai? Ticket?  
Ticket. Tee-ket…                                       
Aditya (to TTE) Mere paas ticket nahin hai. 
Geet looks at him.

Train Seats
The TTE is sitting, taking out some registers from his pouch. Aditya is sitting in front. Geet is  
sitting on the side. 
Geet(explaining to the TTE) Actually dekhiye kya hua ki iska plan jo hai na vo aakhri moment pe  
bana. Ticket banane ka time hi nahin tha. Vaise aap ko to pata hi hai  
ki train khaali hai. To aap ab inki ticket bana deejiye, no problem. Hai  
na? Bhaisaab aap convince ho gaye hain ya main aur boloon. 
The TTE gives her a look, then turns to Aditya. 
TTE Kahan ki ticket banaoon?
Aditya looks back at the TTE. 
TTE Kahan jaana hai aapne?
Aditya Ye train kahan jaati hai?
TTE Kya?
Geet looks at Aditya, then turns to the TTE.
GeetLast stop. Dilli. Dilli ki ticket banaiye. Dekhiye, main aapko bata hi doo ki – haadsa hua hai inke  
saath. Bura waqt hai. Tab hi ye… Dilli.

The TTE leaves. Geet is looking at Aditya in amazement. She giggles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Geet Kya boss? Chakkar kya hai? Drugs shrugs lee hai? 
Aditya does not reply. She comes closer. 
GeetDekho aisa hai ki life mein koi problem hai to mujhe bata sakte ho. I don't mind. Bata do. Bade  
saare dost mujhe apni problems batate hain aur main unhien solve  
karti hoon, pata hai? Us type ki hoon main – agony aunt hoti hai na,  
magazines mein article aate hain? Vaisi… To batao kya baat hai.  
Bolo. Batao batao, sharmao nahin. Batao kya problem hai. Bolo na.  
Aditya (bursts) Tum ho meri problem. Tum… Bolti ja rahi ho, bolti ja rahi ho… Tumhien samajh mein  
nahin aa raha ki main tumse baat karne mein interested nahin hoon?  
Main nahin baat karna chahta tumse. Mujhe nahin janna hai ki tum  
Bhatinda se aayi ho ya Banaras se… ab tak hostel mein rehti thi ya  
brothel mein. Mujhe maaf karo, please. 
He turns away. Silence. He turns back towards her. She is looking at him. 
Geet (calm) Brothel vaali baat theek nahin thi. 
He looks at her. 
Aditya I'm sorry. Really… I'm sorry. Mera vo matlab nahin tha. 
Geet (back to herself) Main jaanti hoon. Clearly dikh raha hai ki maha upset ho tum kisi baat se. Tab  
hi mujhpar bhi upset ho gaye aur bakwaas karne lage. Magar it's okay.  
Main bura nahin maan rahi hoon, haan? Actually aaj kal mujhe kisi  
baat ka bura nahin lagta. Pata hai kyon? Kyonki meri shaadi hone  
waali hai. Bahut jaldi. Aur suno, bhaag ke shaadi kar rahi hoon. Vo  
sikh nahin hai na, log manenge nahin. Magar shaadi ho jaane ke baad  
koi kya kar sakta hai? Ja ke pairon pe gir jaana hai unke, maaf to  
karna hi padega. Manali mein rehta hai vo. Shaadi ke baad hum  
pahadon mein rahenge. Mujhe na pahad bahut pasand hain. Really…  
(snip)
Aditya sighs secretly as Geet rambles on. 
Geet (OC)Ek to ye hill aur mountain ke beech fark kya hai mujhe aaj tak samajh nahin aayi. Bade  
hills mountain hote hain magar kitne bade? Koi aisi measurement hai?  
(snip)
Geet is talking in usual enthusiasm.
GeetBachpan se hi na mujhe shadi karne ka craze hai by god. Aur ab to main ruk hi nain sakti. Bas  
wait kar rahi thi ki mera college khatam ho jaye aur uski travel agency  
shuroo ho jaye. 
Aditya sits helplessly.

Train, Small Station Platform 
Geet wakes up at night. She is on the top aisle berth. She mumbles.
Geet(mumbling) …jab ki na joote achche nahin milte vahan… Tab hi to main…
She rubs her face, looks around. She lifts her head to look out of the window across.  
The train is at a stop. It is a small platform, looks like an unscheduled stop. 
Inside, Geet turns her head to look at the berth below her. Aditya is not there. The train whistle  
blows. She looks up the aisle and down. She is a bit worried. 
(snip)
She gets down the berth, walks down the passage. 
The train has begun to move.  
A man is standing at the footboard as Geet is seen coming out of the compartment near the  
basins. She glances down the platform, then goes towards the toilets. She is back in a flash.
Geet(to the man at the door) Ek minute bhaisaab. 
She moves to the door as the man moves in. She looks out at the platform in tension. She reacts  
on seeing Aditya. 
GeetArey…
We see Aditya. He is walking away in the other direction.  
Geet(screaming) Oye… Train chhoot rahi hai. 
Aditya does not hear, keeps sauntering away in the other direction. 
 page : 13 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Geet(screaming louder) Arey suno… O hero… Hello…
The man returns to the door, looks out. 
Man(to Geet) Naam kya hai?
Geet(screaming) O bhaisaab… 
Man(to Geet) Bhaisaab naam hai? 
Geet(screaming) Arey idhar dekho…
Man(to Geet) Aapke saath hai?
Geet(to Man in irritation) Arey yaar…
Man(screaming) O bhaisaab…
The other people on the platform notice the screaming, but not Aditya. He now sits on a bench,  
looking the other way. 
Geet gets off the train, darts a few steps. 
Man(calling her) O behenji, kya kar rahi hain?
Geet(screaming) Arey O mister, train chhoot rahi hai. Oye…
He is sitting on the bench. Geet looks at the train, looks at him. She calculates. Then runs  
towards Aditya with all her might, screaming after him. 
GeetO kaali pant… O Bombay waale, suno… Arey… 
She reaches him, pushes him. He turns to her. 
GeetPaagal ho tum? Train jaa rahi hai, chalo.
Aditya looks at her, looks at the train, looks back at her, doesn't move. 
Geet(stunned) Kya… Maro saale…
She turns and runs back towards the train. She would reach the train. Her compartment has  
passed, but she can get up from some other. The train has picked up speed. She runs at full speed, totally  
focussed on to an open door. So focussed on the door that she does not see something coming in her way. 
Woman (OC)Arey, arey, arey…
Geet collides and falls and screams. She has hit against a fat, middle-aged woman carrying a  
basket of tomatoes. The woman is on the floor now, tomatoes are rolling in all directions. 
WomanArey, dekho to… Dekho kya kar diya… 
Geet orients herself, tries to get up, squishes a tomato and slips. The woman catches her.
WomanBhaag rahi hai, iska harjaana kaun bharega?
 page : 14 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------GeetArey chhodo train ja rahi hai
Geet frees herself and moves away, squishing some more tomatoes. The train is bounding away.  
She screams after the train at the top of her voice as she limps forward with all her might. 
Geet(screaming) Roko… Train ko roko. Arey koi chain kheencho. Roko train ko… Arey…
The train picks up speed and goes away. She runs to a stop at the end of the platform, looking at  
the train in despair. She turns around, panting heavily. She can't believe this is happening to her. She  
looks at the station. There is a signal boy, some vendors ready to sleep under blankets near their shops –  
everyone looking at her in pity. Except the woman who she had knocked down, who is collecting her  
tomatoes and still abusing. 
Woman(distant) Arey itni moti aurat, itna bada tokra, kisi andhe ko bhi dikh jaaye aur ye paagal… Kya  
jaane kis kis kone mein ghus gaye hain tamatar. (to the people helping her) Arey  
saamne se to main bhi le loongi… udhar waale do…
Geet is at a complete loss. She turns to look at the train again. She looks at the platform again. 
(snip)
Aditya is still sitting on the bench, looking at her as she approaches. She charges in. 
GeetYou bloody weirdo. Kis duniya mein ho tum, haan? Meri train miss kara dee hai tumne. Mera  
saara samaan, sab kuch chala gaya aur main in kapdon mein, slippers pehne, Barnagar  
naam ke station ke is godforsaken platform par khadi hoon aur (loud) ab main kya  
karoongi? Haan?
Aditya(equally annoyed) Kisne kaha tha tumhein train se utarne ko? Tum apne kaam se kaam nahin  
rakh sakti?
Geet(loud) O… Meri ghalti hai? Besharam… Main tumhaari help kar rahi thi. Tumhein thank you  
bolna chahiye. Aur tum attitude dikha rahe ho?  
AditaOkay. Thank you. Thank you ki tumne meri madad karne ki koshish ki. Theek hai? Ab mera  
peecha chhodogi?
GeetPeecha chhodogi? Achcha… Itna aasaan nahin hai. Tumhaari vajah se meri train miss hui hai to  
ab tum mujhe Bhatinda pahunchaoge, mere ghar tak, aur mere saare saamaan ke saath?  
Ji haan. Main tumhein chhodne waali nahin hoon, koi doubt mat rakhna dil mein.  
Sikhni hoon main Bhatinda ki. 
 Aditya is looking at her, figuring out the situation. Geet is looking back at Aditya boldly. He  
looks towards the exit of the station, looks back at her. He suddenly turns and runs. 
Geet(screaming) Arey… Bhaag raha hai… 
She runs after him. He runs up the foot-bridge and goes towards the exit looking at the train  
chugging away in the distance. She is following him with all her might.
Geet(screaming) Arey padko… Pakdo us aadmi ko. Chor hai, chor… Bhaag raha hai chor, pakdo… 
A guard steps up to Aditya as he is leaving the station gate. 
GuardRuk…

Aditya pushes the guard on the side. The guard looks in distress towards him. Then he looks at

looks at the road in front, panting. She sees Aditya talking to the driver of a taxi. She makes to call him,  
but he calls her first. 
Aditya(calling) Jaldi karo.
Geet rushes and sits in the rear of the taxi, understanding Aditya's plan to chase the train.  
GeetChalo, chalo, chalo. 
Many photographs of deities on the dashboard of the car. The driver folds his hands to them,  
then starts the routine of touching the deity then his eyebrow then lips then eyebrow then lips, another  
diety then eyebrow. Geet is looking impatiently at this. 
Geet Haan haan ho gaya, sun lee oopar waale ne, ab chalo.

The train is chugging away at great speed. 
The taxi is rolling away at a comfortably low speed. The driver's elbow is out on the window and  
he is driving as he must be driving every day. Geet is sitting behind, looking at him in disbelief.
GeetYe kya kar rahe ho tum? Aise train pakdenge hum? 
DriverTrain to aap kaise bhi na pakdenge. Ratlam hai agla tesan. Sau kilometre. 
The driver snickers, starts to hum a melodious folk tune as Geet looks at him in desperation. She  
turns to Aditya. 
Geet(disbelief) He's mad. He's totally mad. 
The folk song goes on.

Ratlam Station Platform
Aditya rushes into the first platform. He sees, stops to gain his breath. Geet rushes in. Sees that  
the train is standing on the platform, right in front of them. Aditya keeps his hand on the A H Wheeler  
stall and dips his head. Geet stops too. She holds her waist and bends, gasps for maximum breath. 
AdityaJao andar.
GeetAur tum?
AdityaDekho. Ab aur meri help mat karna. Please. Apne kaam se…
The driver rushes and collides into Aditya. Aditya almost falls down. 
Driver(desperate) Mera paisa… paisa do, mera paisa baaki hai.
AdityaAbey ruk. 
Aditya removes him at an arms length, takes out his wallet. 
Geet comes up as Aditya is taking money out of his wallet and giving to the driver. 
AdityaDekho kitna hai…
GeetChange borrow kar sakti hoon… Paani lena hai. 
Aditya gives her two tens. The driver is sneaking into the wallet. Aditya looks at him crossly. 
DriverAur hai na?
GeetTrain mein return karti hoon… 
Geet walks out towards a stall. Meanwhile – 
Aditya(becoming OC) Tu chup-chaap khada reh, main de raha hoon paise.
A typical Railway Platform stall selling small eats and soft drinks. Two vendors seen inside. The  
one facing looks at Geet as she approaches and puts the money on the deck. She is still exhausted and  
breathless. 
GeetPaani. 
She picks up a bottle and opens it. The hawker begins to get change. 
Geet(to vendor) Saans band ho gayee by god. Cola shola sab apni jagah par hai par paani ka kaam  
paani hi karta hai. Kehte hain na – best things in the world are free… Vaise ab paani to  
free raha nahin… Kitne ka hai?

Geet(fight for right mode) Kyon? Railway ke daam to kam hote hain. 
Vendor(OC)Yehi rate hai… 
GeetAchcha? Consumer court se poochoon kya rate hai? Hain…? Ulloo banaate ho…? 
VendorDo rupiya ke liye itna jhik-jhik? 
GeetDo rupaye kuch nahin hote to chori kyon kar rahe ho? 
VendorChori…
GeetAur kya? Aur kehte ho main jhik-jhik kar rahi hoon? Paise do vaapas. 
The vendor looks at her crossly and makes to give two rupees back to her. Then she takes a gulp.  
The vendor returns a coin and turns to fold up his shop. Geet picks up the change, takes another gulp of  
water and turns. Suddenly, her heart stops. No, this can not be. We see that the train is rushing away. She  
holds her head. There is no chance of catching the train. Then she brings her hands down. She gulps the  
water. The train has almost left the station now. Suddenly, she starts running down the platform.
Geet(screaming) Roko… Train ko roko. Arey koi chain kheencho. Roko train ko… Arey…
But the train is long gone. Geet runs to a stop at the end of the platform, looking at the train. She  
turns around, stung by disbelief. She just stands, looking straight. This is a much bigger station than the  
other one. Many more hawkers, more people sleeping under blankets. She turns back to look at the train.  
Turns again towards the platform. She holds her forehead with both hands and lowers to her haunches.

The station masters office board is seen. She looks around once again, then walks into the office.  
The men who were looking at her move up to the door, peep inside. A few others join them. They are

Master (OC)Kota hai agla station. Main vahan ke station master ko inform kar doonga.

Suddenly, at the door behind her, a young man is pushed inside by the others. He hits against

done.

He holds two of his index fingers parallel to each other.

He is enjoying this, feeling good to talk. He takes a more comfortable position and continues.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Song # 1
Aditya begins to hum something. Geet and he are sprawled out in the bus stand in Ratlam. Geet  
looks at him. He looks at her, begins to sing the line. There is thin music accompaniment. He gets up to  
sit and sings. 
Music thickens with the the sun rising in Ratlam. The bus is travelling on the state highway and  
Aditya is singing the song. 
The song is about travel. Aditya is going with the flow. He does not know where he will end up  
but he wants to keep going. 
This is the song of a man coming out from the shackles of his life and moving into freedom. Geet  
is the catalyst for this change. 
In the song, Aditya is getting infected by her bright spirit. He is even copying her subconsciously.  
His body language changes in the song. 
After the bus, Aditya is singing as he walks down a street in Kota with Geet. 
In the music interlude, we see that Aditya withdraws cash from an ATM. Then they take Geet's  
luggage from the station and keep it in the cab he has hired. Aditya is wearing new clothes. 
The car is on the highway now. Aditya and Geet are sleeping in the back seat. 
Geet is seen drawing water from a hand-pump on the way. Both splash water on themselves. 
The car drives through a procession of camels. 
Somewhere on the road, the car's tyre is punctured, the driver is repairing it. Aditya and Geet are  
sitting on a milestone. 
Then Aditya is driving, Geet is sitting next to him and the driver is sleeping in the back seat. 
At the end of the song, the car is standing at a dhaba somewhere in Punjab. Aditya and Geet are  
climbing a guava tree that is slanted on a water stream on the side of the dhaba.

Guava Tree on Stream
Aditya and Geet are sitting on a branch of the tree, eating guavas. Water is flowing beneath  
them.
GeetTum to kamaal ho yaar. Maine apni life mein kisi ko itna achcha gaate huye nahin suna.  
Tumhien to singer hona chahiye. 
AdityaSab kuch jo insaan chahta hai, vo milta kahan hai yaar?
GeetKyon? Mujhe to lagta hai ki insaan jo kuch bhi real mein chahta hai na, actual mein, usko life  
mein vohi milta hai.  
AdityaEk time tha jab main real mein chahta tha, actual mein. Music se bada passion nahin tha meri  
life mein. 
GeetLife khatam ho chuki hai tumhari? Baat aise kar rahe ho jaise mar chuke ho. 
Aditya(smiles) Mara to nahin hoon. Magar ab music – vusic nahin ho sakta meri life mein.   
GeetKyon?  Kyon nahin ho sakta? Aisi kya majboori hai, batao mujhe. 
He looks down, looks away. 
GeetO  god. Okay yaar, okay. Mat batao. Magar phir se angry young man mat ban jao, okay?
Aditya(suddenly bright) Okay. 
Pause.
GeetMain hi baat shuroo karti hoon. 
AdityaOf course.
GeetHmm… (looks down at the stream) Pani achcha hai na. 
AdityaHaan.
Geet(idea) Kabhi kisi ped se neher mein jump lagayee hai tumne?
Aditya turns sharply to her, tries to read her. 
Aditya(insecure) Geet, chalo ab neeche utarte hain. Come on.
GeetTry karna chahiye. Bahut mazaa aayega. Chalo. 
Aditya(serious) Geet, Geet. Main tumse poochna chahta tha. Kabhi psychiatrist ko consult kiya hai  
tumne?
GeetOh shut up.

She holds his hand. 
AdityaGeet suno, Geet really man, Geet…
Geet takes him by his hand and both jump into the water stream with a loud scream. 
They frolic and play in the stream. 
They get out of the water, wearing all their clothes and shoes, shivering.

Wet shirts are dumped close to the fire. This is the kitchen area of the dhaba which is the make-

Silence. Then Geet appears in front, in shock. 
Geet(stunned) Tum Aditya… Kashyap ho?
AdityaNow you know me.
GeetYou are the Kashyap? Vo tumhaari ma thi jo kisi ke saath bhaag gayee thi? 
He flinches. 
GeetShit. I'm sorry. 
AdityaHaan, meri maa thi. Jo bhaag gayee thi kisi ke saath. 
GeetVo yaar, news-views mein isi tarah ki language mein suna tha na. Vaise hi nikal gaya. I'm really  
sorry yaar. Really.  
AdityaNo Geet. Mujhe sunna padega. Tum kyon sorry bol rahi ho? Kisi ki ma agar itni cheap hai, itni  
giri hui harkat kar sakti hai to… 
GeetMr Kashyap, aapko unke baare mein itni budtameezi se baat nahin karni chahiye.
Aditya(sudden anger) Kyon nahin karni chahiye, haan? Us aurat ne hamaari family ko destroy kar diya,  
zindagi bhar ke liye mujhe saari duniya ke aage sharminda kar diya, main kyon nahin  
budtameezi se baat karoon?  
GeetKyonki vo… pyaar mein thi yaar.

aisa kiya to zaroor us aadmi ke pyaar mein hogi. Aur jab koi pyaar mein hota hai to koi  
sahi-ghalat nahin hota.
Aditya has been staring at her in disbelief.
AdityaKisne bataya tumhein ye sab? Kis ghatiya novel mein tumne ye lines padhi hain?
GeetSab log kehte hain. All is fair is love.
Aditya(spite) Jhoot kehte hain sab. It's all bull-shit. Samjhi tum?
Geet(promptly, to quell the anger) Samajh gayee.
Silence as Aditya reels in his anger. Then –
GeetSuno. Tum to bahut hi ameer nikle yaar. Please meri behen ke saath bhaag jao.

Bhatinda. The gardener has opened the gate. He runs after the car as it drives up to the porch.

Geet opens the door. A sikh boy of ten comes running out to the portico and sees Geet. 
GeetHi Amrik. 
Amrik turns and runs inside shouting.

Geet's father and uncle and other middle-aged Sikhs crowd around Aditya, pat his back. Old  
Sikh 
looks at Aditya, back at Geet. 
DadajiAur to koi dosti nahin hai? Kyonki meri umar mein ek jhalak mein dikh jaata hai ki ladke-ladki

GeetYe jo Khosla hain, hamaare bade puraane family friends hain. Manjeet aur main bachpan se  
saath rahe hain. Sab kehte the ki ye dono bade honge to inki shaadi kara denge. Mujhe  
bada mazaa aata tha ye soch kar ki meri shaadi hogi Manjeet ke saath. Ghar-ghar  
khelne mein main kabhi Roop ko Manjeet ki wife nahin banne deti thi. Aath saal ki  
umar mein Manjeet aur main haath pakad kar is ped ke neech khade hote the – ke ji us  
khet ke pare hum apna ghar banaenge. Phir main badi ho gayee, aur is Manjeet episode

serious hain. Sab serious hain. Aur meri band baj gayee.

AdityaBelieve me, Geet aur mere beech kuch bhi nahin hai. Bombay mein hum ek doosre ko jaante bhi

GeetCongratulations. Tumne saara kaam kharaab kar diya. Maine itna achcha scene set kiya. Manjeet

Calling Cards. Par India ke andar calling cards ka vichaar aapko kaise aaya?

AnshumanDekhiye, dialogue maarna asaan hai. Meri situation kya hai, vo main jaanta hoon. Main  
rehta hoon yahan. Mere ghar waale hain, society hai, kaam-dhandha hai aur hazaar  
tereh ki tension hai. Ek din, achanak, vo yahan land hoti hai aur kehti hai ki chalo hum  
abhi shaadi kar lete hain. Abhi, isi waqt. To aapke hisaab se mujhe kya karna chahiye

AdityaDepend karte hai ki tum us se pyaar karte ho na nahin. 
Anshuman(smirks) Ye to height hai. Dekhiye, aap bahut bade aadmi hain, magar main aapke  
saamne apne pyaar ka imtihan dene waala nahin hoon, samjhe na?  
AdityaZaroorat bhi nahin hai. Agar tumne uski zindagi barbaad kar dee hai to ye to clear hai ki tum

Geet waves from a distance and runs down into the open cafeteria. Anshuman stands and walks

to talk and scold her. Her happiness begins to fade away. The lyrics of the song begin. She stares at  
Anshuman as her face changes to disbelief. She is stunned for a while, then she speaks. She is cut short.  
Tears come to her eyes. She begins to plead. She is asked to go away. She pleads some more. Anshuman  
walks away. She stands there for a while, tears flowing down her cheek. Then she slowly turns and walks  
back the way she had come. She climbs up the steps. 
She is sitting on a bench at the place where Aditya had dropped her. 
Evening time, she is seen walking up towards a hotel.

direction. Her heart begins to beat aloud. She walks towards him. Anshuman is talking to another man.

numbness. She stands there for a long time, cheek burning in shame. Then she walks back.

manner. She is struggling to keep her hope alive. Hostel, school, some lonely corners of the city.
And one day, as she is walking up to school, we see that Aditya walks up in the distance, looking  
at her. He has found her. But he does not go up to her immediately. He trails her at a distance for the day.  
She looks like the ghost of the girl Aditya knew. He is so sensitive to her right now that if she stumbles a  
bit while walking, he tends to leap out and hold her. But he does not do that. Finally, she walks up  
towards her hostel. She sees Aditya sitting there.

GeetThanks

Geet rushes to Aditya and flings herself to hug him. 
Aditya moves backwards with her force. 
Aditya's back comes against the wall. He holds her waist for balance.
She shifts her mouth to his neck.
His hand runs on her side.
She puts her forehead on his chest. 
Aditya closes his eyes. He controls himself, removes his hands. Geet looks up at him. Pause. She  
separates from him. There is a moment of awkwardness. She looks away, gathers her hair. He keeps  
looking straight. 
AdityaHaan to theek hai na yaar. Ho jaata hai kabhi kabhi, aage nahin hoga, aisi koi tension ki baat  
nahin hai. (moves to the table) Mujhe bahut bhook lag rahi hai. Kya order kiya hai?   
He moves to the food trolley. Begins to eat. 
AdityaAur kal tum mujhe Shimla ghumaogi, samjhi?

Anshuman is sitting in the lobby, waiting for them. He turns and sees them. He gets up and moves

Anshuman walks up. Geet looks at him. Anshuman walks up, straight to Geet. Geet is stunned.

When you spoke to me last night… when you used all those words… it just opened my eyes… What was I  
doing? I was trying to forget about you, but it wasn't possible. Anshuman looks at Aditya. It was too  
sudden for me, Anshuman continues. She just landed up in Manali that day and I could not handle it…  
Anshuman looks at Geet now. I did not have the courage to take you to my house. But today I care a damn

Aditya is standing reclined on the back of the couch. He is in deep introspection. After a while,  
footsteps are heard and Geet comes in. He looks at her. Her eyes are red with tears. I can't believe this,  
she says. He leaves me on the streets one day and nine months later he comes and says sorry. Just like  
that. Is it so simple? How can I forget and forgive him so easily? Don't forgive him, he says. Trouble him.  
Take your revenge. You have your lifetime to do that. She looks at him. You know Geet, he says. My  
parents did not love each other. They loved other people. And my entire life I have suffered because of  
that. They were great together in the office, but home was hell. They should have just followed their  
hearts and sooner or later everything would have sorted out, isn't it? Geet is looking at him. This man has  
caused you pain, Aditya continues. He took too much time, you suffered, so punish him as you see fit. But  
don't turn him away. That will be a mistake. I can't believe, Geet says, that you are arguing his case.  
Aditya smiles, he touches her head. I am arguing your case too Geet, he says. Both your cases are the  
same. It's simple – you love each other so you need to be together. That's how everyone will be happy.  
She is looking at him. And you, she asks. What about you? Well, he says. You have your first extra-
marital affair with me, then I'll be happy too. She smiles. He smiles. The smiles fade away. No Aditya,  
she says. I can't do this. Follow your heart Geet, he says. Everything will sort out. Pause. He extends his  
hand. Music of Song # 6 begins. Geet gives him her hand. She is looking at him. He smiles at her.

The gardener runs up to open the gate. He is very happy, is trying to peer inside the car. Aditya  
looks at Geet in the rear-view mirror. She is very nervous. Anshuman is looking out of the window at the  
house. All the best, Aditya tells Geet. They are here, they are here, Amrik shouts as he runs inside after  
seeing them. Aditya drives inside. He sees that the porch is decorated with flowers. People spill out into  
the verandah from inside. It is a huge gathering. Apart from the family, there seem to be relatives, friends  
– all wearing good clothes, in celebration mode. Geet's brothers are there. They herd the car into the  
courtyard. Geet is sitting in the rear, tears coming to her eyes. Anshuman is surprised by the ambience.

car stops in the courtyard. The gathering moves towards the car. Aditya looks at Geet. Anshuman is  
looking around in surprise. Roop rushes to the door and pulls Geet out. She embraces Geet, sobbing.  
Geet's mother comes to her, embraces her. Geet is sobbing too. The swarm of people envelope Geet.  
Everyone hugs her, everyone kisses her, everyone asks her not to cry as she is moved up the stairs into the  
verandah. Angry uncle comes towards Aditya. He opens his door and brings him out. He has tears in his  
eyes. He embraces Aditya. Thank you, he is saying. Thank you son. I had not believed you when you said  
you will get her. But you did. We will never forget this. He takes Aditya's hand and brings him to the  
veranda. Aditya meets Geet's father. Roop rushes in with a flower garland and puts it around Aditya's  
neck. Kyon jijaji, she says. Aditya looks up sharply at Roop. He looks around at everyone. The situation  
hits him. He looks towards Geet. Geet is with her mother and others. They are wiping her tears. Roop  
turns Aditya's face to herself. What happened, she says. Can't take your eyes off her, haan? She pulls  
Geet next to him. Happy now, she asks. Geet is looking at Roop in question. Arey Roop tu hat, Sexy Aunt  
says. Let us see them together. A swarm of ladies with expectant eyes moves into position to see Aditya  
and Geet together. How nice they look together, the older ones say. Made for each other. Some people  
start circling money around their heads to protect from any 'nazar'. It dawns upon Geet. She is frozen.  
She looks at Aditya. Aditya looks at her. They stand there, stumped. Aditya looks towards Anshuman.  
Anshuman is still in the car. He is gaping at what is happening. Angry chacha follows Aditya's look.  
Arey, get that boy also, he orders. Geet's younger brothers run towards Anshuman, opens the door of the  
car. He is your friend, chacha asks Aditya. Aditya looks at him, nods. The boys run Anshuman up the  
steps of the porch. Come beta, welcome, says angry chacha. Anshuman just looks at him. Then he looks at  
Geet and Aditya. By now, Geet's mother had made her way in front of Geet and Aditya with a thali of  
sweets. She picks up a sweet and makes Aditya take a bite. Then she brings the remainder of the sweet to  
Geet's mouth. Love increases by eating 'jootha', she says. Aditya looks at Anshuman. The sweet is in  
front of Geet's face. Mother puts it into her mouth. Anshuman does not know what the bloody hell is  
happening out here. His hands are in the question mark positions. Aditya is looking at him. But Geet's  
mother kisses him on the forehead. He looks at Geet. He gets his mouth close to her ear. Tell them fast,  
Aditya is saying. Yes, Geet says. Ae, kya ho raha hai, Roop and the other saalis scream. Aditya looks at  
Roop, smiles. Ma, Geet turns to her mother and says. Come in, mother says. Come. Aditya and Geet are  
taken into the hall. And it's not a simple going in – it's the ritual of entering house. Enter together,  
mother is saying. They make to step in through the threshold. Not like this, Roop says. You had gone  
holding hands. So you will have to hold hands as you enter. Anshuman is looking at Roop, now he looks  
at Geet and Aditya. Aaj badi sharam aa rahi hai, Roop says to Aditya and Geet and makes them hold  
hands. Geet looks at Aditya, as though apologizing. He knows that she needs support at this time. They  
step in together. There is massive clapping and rejoicing. Geet is still clutching Aditya's hand. Anshuman  
comes in. Aditya makes to release his hand. Geet realizes that she has to let go. She turns to her mother.  
Ma I have to talk to you, she says. Come… First meet Darji, mother says, then there is a long booking  
with all the relatives and friends. Come, she says. Roop, take them. Aditya and Geet are taken away.

Roop looks at Anshuman. He gets up from the bed, looking at them in confusion. Oh, Roop says. He is  
here too? Geet… in front of him? Shut up, says Geet. She looks at Aditya. Tomorrow morning outside,  
like last time, Aditya says quickly. Roop raises objection, takes Geet away. Bye, jijaji, Roop says as she  
closes the door. Have a good night with your friend. They giggle away. What's happening, Anshuman  
asks. Geet had come to meet you, Aditya says. You can meet her early morning. Aditya goes to the  
window. He sees Geet going into her room. He stands there, looking at her room. She appears at her  
window and looks at him. He smiles. She smiles. They stand for a second. He indicates to her that she  
should go to sleep. She indicates to him that he should go to sleep. He nods. Waves to her. She waves  
back. He moves from the window. He takes support of the wall and stands. For a while. Then he switches  
the light off.

Sc # 73 Morning, Exteriors
Behind Bhatinda House / Backyard
The sun rises in Punjab. The house is still asleep. Geet comes out of the back door, makes her  
way to the tree where she had met Aditya nine months back. Aditya and Anshuman are sitting there.  
Aditya gets up on seeing Geet and walks towards the house. Hi, he says as he crosses her. When are you  
leaving, she asks. Soon, he says. They will not let you go, she says. This time I won't stop, he says. He  
smiles, walks away. She looks at him go for a moment. Anshuman comes to her. Geet, he says. This is  
completely absurd yaar… Why don't you tell them, what is the matter with you? She looks at him. It's not  
at all complicated Geet, he says. All you have to do, he explains systematically, is to tell your mother, or  
anyone… that yes you are in love, and you will get married… only not with Aditya, but with Anshuman.  
Whatever the plan is can go on without a hitch, everyone can remain as happy as they are, only Aditya  
has to be replaced by Anshuman. Simple. She looks at him. Once you tell them this, they will ask a  
thousand questions – arey, howcome, this that… And you tell them the answers – How you met me…  
How you were at the hostel in Bombay and how I used to come with my friend to meet his girlfriend…  
Remember that evening… you were coming down the steps when you met me for the first time… Tell  
them how we started going out without our friends… alone… How we used to sit on Marine Drive for  
hours… Tell them about that evening, on the way back from Elephanta… How we had stood on the

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------streamer. Anshuman goes on talking, but gradually, Geet stops hearing him. Anshuman's mouth is  
moving but there is no sound. Geet is staring at him, but not seeing him any more. Her mind is elsewhere.  
Flash of the train. Geet sees Aditya for the first time. He is sitting on her seat, looking down.
Geet is standing in front of Anshuman outside her house in Bhatinda. 
Outside Ratlam railway station. Geet hugs Aditya, relieved to have him there. 
Geet parts with Aditya in Manali. 
Geet flings herself on Aditya after she had abused Anshuman on the phone. He holds her and his  
back comes against the wall. He holds her waist for balance, runs his hands on her sides, she lifts her face  
to his chest. 
Geet, in the present time, turns abruptly and starts walking back to the house. Anshuman stops  
his talk, surprised. Geet, he calls out. You are going right now…? Geet does not reply, she moves away.  
Wait, I'm coming too, he says, coming after her. Geet rushes, she runs. She enters the house, comes to the  
backyard, rushes up, looking around. She sees Aditya in the backyard. He is with Amrik, teaching him to  
fire air-rifle. Geet rushes up and reaches Aditya. Aditya looks at her. What happened, Aditya asks. Geet is  
tense, her breath is up. What happened, he asks again. Is he coming, Geet asks. Who, he asks. Anshuman,  
she says. Is he coming? Yes, he says. Is he looking this side, she asks. Yes, Aditya says. Geet flings  
herself on Aditya. She holds him and this time she is holding nothing back. Anshuman freezes on his  
tracks. He sees Geet and Aditya. He is shocked. What is the meaning of this? But he is not as shocked as  
Aditya. Aditya's mind is racing, not coming to any result. Geet faces Aditya. The one favour you have  
done for me, which I can never repay you for, is bringing Anshuman back, she tells Aditya. Otherwise I  
would never have known what I truly feel. Aditya stares at her in disbelief. I am going to follow my heart  
now Aditya, she says. And everything will sort out. She kisses him. He holds her and kisses her. He kisses  
her with the anguish of all the times when he had stopped himself from kissing her. The kid is looking at  
them with a wide grin as they kiss right in front of his eyes. Anshuman turns away, holds his head in  
grievous bewilderment. Geet and Aditya stand together in the backyard. They will always be together  
now. Nothing can separate them.

Sc # 74 Day, Interiors
Bhatinda House – Dadaji's Room
Flash-forward. Ten years later. Geet and Aditya are sitting on a couch. Their two sons are with  
them. Old Sikh, very old now, is lying on the bed and looking at them. Bachchon, very old sikh is saying.  
Tere ma-baap bade shaitaan hain. Inhone baar-baar jhooth bola ki inke beech kuch nahin hai. Magar  
maine pehli nazar mein pakad liya tha ki ye premi hain, hai ki nahin? Haanji dadaji, Aditya says. Aur  
dekho, vohi sach nikla ki nahin? Haanji, dadaji, Geet says. Geet and Aditya are holding hands behind  
their children, looking at each other and smiling secretly as very old sikh continues – Arey bachche,  
hamaari umar mein waqt nahin lagta. Ek jhalak kaafi hoti hai ye pehchaanne ke liye ki… 
Song # 7
And in the present time in Bhatinda, the nagada plays and the hands clap and voices sing and the  
rituals take place and the sweets are eaten and the gifts pile up. Cars come in from Bombay with Raghav  
and Aditya's mother. Aditya walks up, rushes and hugs his mother. His mother holds him dearly, crying.  
Geet's mother comes and hugs her. Aditya's mother sees Geet. She gives her necklace, her ear-rings and  
all her gold bangles to her, crying. Then she starts dancing with Geet's mother, in the Punjabi style that is  
common to both. And how they dance. And father dances and the uncle dances and the aunty dances and

completely improvised. 
Geet and Aditya are dancing in high-speed, looking at each other in the crowd. Fade-out.
